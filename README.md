## Description

As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, I want to understand JavaScript, HTML, and CSS better to eventually create high-end websites for clients. I built this project to create a web-based day planner to help people their work days. I learned about using third party APIs and furthered my knowledge of DOM hooks and using JavaScript to change HTML.
